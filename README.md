# Rippio
Rippio is being developed to be a web application that connects people with restaurants. Your favorite foods in one place.

# Website
[Visit Rippio](https://rippio.netlify.app/)

# How it Works
Rippio includes two methods of use: as a client or as a restaurant. Both can create an account, sign in, and change their password if forgotten.

## As a Client
- **Manage Profile:** Upload a profile photo, update your information, payment methods, and address.
- **View Orders and Credits:** Keep track of your orders and credits.
- **Use the Cart:** Add products to the cart, which can be used without an account and will be saved for your next session. Proceed to pay when ready.
- **Make Orders:** When you pay, you create an order, allowing you to see the order details and generate credits. (Note: Payments are not real, but you must add a real credit card, which can be generated from a website generator).
- **Purchase Plans:** Buy various plans to enhance your experience and receive additional benefits.
